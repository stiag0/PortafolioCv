## 🎓 Key Principle Applied

**"Know it" ≠ "Used it on this project"**

Your updated CV now:
- ✅ Lists ALL technologies you know in the skills section
- ✅ Only claims specific technology use in projects where you ACTUALLY used them
- ✅ Doesn't lie about what was used where
- ✅ Shows Azure/Microsoft experience from Tigo
- ✅ Shows Firebase (not AWS) for Central de Belleza
- ✅ Doesn't claim Docker/Kubernetes for El Mundo de Laura

---

## 📝 What This Means for Interviews

When asked:
- **"Do you know AWS?"** → YES (you have certification)
- **"Did you use AWS at Central de Belleza?"** → NO (used Firebase/Vercel)
- **"Do you know Docker?"** → YES (you have knowledge)
- **"Why didn't you use Docker at El Mundo de Laura?"** → Client rejected implementation
- **"What Microsoft technologies do you know?"** → Azure, VBA, Power BI, Power Query, Power Automate (from Tigo)

---

## ⚠️ Important Note

The CV generation script in `scripts/generate-cv-simple.js` **tries to import from data.ts directly**, which won't work easily. 

### Recommended Approach:

**Option 1: Use the corrected main CV (online version)**
- Your online CV at `cv-nextjs/src/app/page.tsx` now has all corrections
- This is your comprehensive, accurate portfolio

**Option 2: Manually create PDFs when needed**
- Use your browser to print the online CV to PDF
- Tailor by hiding/showing relevant sections for each job

**Option 3: I can create standalone HTML files with correct data**
- Let me know if you want me to create new standalone HTML files
- I'll manually code them with the corrected information

---

## ✅ Current Status

### Fixed in Main Data (`src/lib/data.ts`):
- ✅ Tigo: Now correctly shows Azure + Microsoft stack
- ✅ Central de Belleza: Now correctly shows Firebase (not AWS)
- ✅ El Mundo de Laura: Doesn't falsely claim Docker/Kubernetes
- ✅ Skills list: Added Microsoft technologies
- ✅ Projects: Added Tigo Microsoft project, corrected technologies

### What You Should Do Next:
1. Review the corrected `src/lib/data.ts` file
2. Check that your online CV displays correctly
3. Let me know if you want me to regenerate the standalone HTML CVs with correct data
4. Test print your online CV to PDF to see how it looks

## 🚀 Your Choice

**Do you want me to:**

**A)** Manually create 6-7 new standalone HTML files with the corrected information?
- I'll code them properly with accurate data
- Each will be tailored for specific job types
- Ready to print to PDF

**B)** Focus on the online CV and you manually adjust for each application?
- Your online CV now has all correct information
- You can print/save as PDF
- Manually emphasize different sections for different jobs

**C)** Create a simpler solution?
- One accurate, comprehensive HTML CV
- You edit it for specific jobs as needed

Let me know what works best for you! The important thing is that **your main data source (`src/lib/data.ts`) is now accurate** and doesn't contain false claims.
